Here are some of my posters, which were prepared for the annual <a href="https://www.bigs-math.uni-bonn.de/events/eventpages/poster-exhibition/poster-exhibition-2022/">BIGS poster exhibition</a> of the doctoral students of Mathematics in Bonn. 
The posters give an idea of my research interests and status.

Here is my Master's thesis.
