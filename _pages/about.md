I am a third year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.bigs-math.uni-bonn.de/"> Bonn international graduate school of Mathematics</a> and a guest at the <a href="https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for Mathematics</a> in Bonn. My supervisor is <a href="https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/blohmann/">Christian Blohmann</a>.
My research interests lie in differential geometry, higher structures and deformation theory. In particular, I am interested in (higher) Lie groupoids, their infinitesimal counterparts and their deformation theory.

<b>Some buzzwords</b>: smooth manifolds, Lie groupoids, Lie algebroids, deformations, differential graded Lie algebras, supermanifolds, (differential) graded manifolds, simplicial objects, category theory...

Before my doctoral studies, I have studied pure Mathematics at the University of Bonn (Masters) and at the American University of Beirut (Bachelors). Besides Mathematics, I have studied music and piano performance and have a high interest in music theory.

Here is my CV.
